                <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                <p>The Uni Marketplace is an independent marketplace, founded in 2021 by University of Brighton students.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>It is a platform that provides our students the opportunity to sell their items across a wide variety of universities. We handle the management of sales across the sites they have been distributed to and deliver to our students regularly updated feedback on the growth of their marketplace via their individual logins on our website. The idea was to create an open and comfortable space for independent students to sell their items.</p>
                <br><br>
